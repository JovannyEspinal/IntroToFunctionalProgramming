# IntroToFunctionalProgramming
This repo is the result of following [Ray Wenderlich's tutorial on an Introduction to Functional Programming](https://www.raywenderlich.com/114456/introduction-functional-programming-swift). My objective is to start familiarizing myself with functional programming before I start a job that requires understanding it.
